                This was the one thing I feared most. The one thing I ran from, the one thing I swore I’d never face
                again. Yet here it was, waiting for me in the shadows. That gnawing emptiness, the unfillable void—it
                wasn’t just back; it had been there all along, lurking beneath every fleeting moment of happiness.



            <p class="p">
                I should have known. I should have known this was temporary, that the vibrant colors you painted my life
                with would fade. But I didn’t think it would happen so soon. I didn’t think it would hurt this much. The
                world we built—our little world of joy and fire—was crumbling. And I was the one tearing it apart, piece
                by piece.


            </p>
            <p class="p">
                Why now? Why, when I finally thought I had escaped this endless cycle? When I thought, for once, that I
                was _better_? I wanted to believe what we had was real, that it was different. But now I don’t know if I
                ever truly loved you, or if I was just chasing the high, the rush, the spark. And yet, it hurts—losing
                you still hurts in ways I can’t even explain.

            </p>

            <p class="p">You deserved so much more. Someone who could hold onto you, someone who wouldn’t turn away the
                moment the fire started to dim. But that wasn’t me. I was never that person. I didn’t know how to hold
                onto anything without breaking it.


            </p>

            <p class="p">You were my light in the dark, my fleeting glimpse of warmth in the cold. But even that wasn’t
                enough. And I hate myself for that. I hate myself for not being able to love you the way you deserved to
                be loved. You gave me everything, and all I could give back was my chaos, my emptiness, my hollow
                promises.

            </p>

            <p class="p">I wanted to tell you the truth. I wanted to let you go gently, to spare you the pain. But how
                do you break someone’s heart softly? How do you tear apart something so fragile without shattering it
                completely?
            </p>

            <p class="p">And now, as I sit here with nothing but memories, I can feel the weight of my own selfishness
                crushing me. You’re gone, and I’m the reason why. You’ll never know how much I wish I could have been
                different—how much I wish I could have stayed.
            </p>

            <p class="p">But the truth is, I’ve always been like this. Hollow, restless, desperate to feel something,
                anything, no matter who gets hurt in the process. I didn’t need fixing. I needed to escape the void
                inside me, even if it meant losing you.


            </p>

            <p class="p">Now all I have left is the ghost of what we were, haunting me in the quiet hours of the night.
                You were my brightest moment, and I let you slip away. And as much as I try to move on, a part of me
                will always stay behind, lost in the memory of you.
            </p>
            <p class="p">I’m sorry. I’m sorry I couldn’t be the person you needed. I’m sorry I let you love me when I
                couldn’t love you back the way you deserved. And I’m sorry that, even now, all I can think about is how
                empty I still feel without you.
            </p>
            <p class="p">You were my everything. And I lost you.
            </p>
