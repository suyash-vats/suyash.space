                Iâ€™m just a dude who decided to make a website to document his life. Iâ€™m not all that special,
                successful, interesting, or brilliant, though others say otherwise. (They would.) I was not prompted to
                challenge myself academically as a pupil. I did what was required to get a top mark and no more; grades
                were all that mattered, however arbitrary they may be. I did not partake in extracurriculars.I was not constituted for the
                endeavor, and even if I was, Iâ€™d still feel the repercussions of battle I was a ghost through college,
                which I attended absentmindedly and virtually compulsorily with no intentions or prudence other than to
                take the easiest courses possible and involve myself no more than physically or mentally required.</p>

           
            <p>
                So: Hi. <span class="highlight">I'm Suyash.</span> My full name is Suyash Vats, but I go by Vashu for
                short. Vashu has a nice ring. You'll probably remember it
            </p>

                I was raised in a middle-class Behror of Rajasthan. The local
                playgrounds are good, and most young residents donâ€™t realize how good they have it. Opportunityâ€™s
                overwhelming.</p>

            <p class="p">I spent my teens absorbed in trivial, introverted pursuits that hindered my ability to speak up
                and as a result I feel Iâ€™m behind the bar. I fear I will ever catch up.

                "to change."
            </div>

            <p class="p">This is nothing more than a mirror. It reflects whateverâ€™s been gunked in my mind and impossible to fully grasp otherwise. The stretches during which Iâ€™ve not regularly divulged my running thoughts, through this medium or another, have been the most sclerotic and self-oblivious of my life Sometimes i'll have guest posts by some of my friends, they'll give a diffrent theme, concept and god forbid even an opinion on things on and around the world</p>
